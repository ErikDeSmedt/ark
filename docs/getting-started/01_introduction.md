# Introduction

The Ark protocol describes the interactions between
the Ark Service Provider (ASP) and their clients. We have
implemented an ASP called `aspd` and a client called `bark`.

Most users will only be interested in running `bark`. First
of all `bark` is a standard bitcoin-wallet that can be used
to store funds onchain. However, it also allows you to participate
in Ark rounds and store your Ark VTXOs.

Both `aspd` and `bark` are simple binaries that can be used
from terminal.

The source code for both binaries is available on [github](https://github.com/ark-bitcoin/ark).
We are not providing compiled binaries yet. However, you can compile `aspd` and `bark` from source.
